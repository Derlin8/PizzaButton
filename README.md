# PizzaButton
Ordering a pizza via AWS IoT button backed by AWS lambda in python.

Disclaimer: An IoT button required to execute Domino's Restraunt API to order a simple pepperoni pizza. Something that went wrong while testing this product was not getting direct feedback, so ended up ordering 10 pizzas on accident. Working on adding feedback after executing lambda function via button push.
